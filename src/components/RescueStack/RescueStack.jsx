            <h1>The Halloween Rescue Stack</h1>
            <p>This is the awesome new stack we’ve
                created and discounted in honor of
                Halloween. It contains all 3 pillars
                of digestion: enzymes, probiotics,
                hydrochloric acid (HCL)—all of which
                are needed more than ever for Halloween.

            <p>
                This powerful, single-strain probiotic
                based on the highly researched strain found
                in cultured foods, called L. Plantarum.
                It is formulated by a patented process that
                creates a “super strain”—ideal for kicking
                out the bad guys and enhancing your digestion.
                Truly the “Navy SEAL” of probiotics! It DEVOURS
                sugar, helping eat up the excess sugar in your
                system and doubles every 15 minutes in the
                presence of sugar!

                Masszymes
            </h3>
            <p>
                Masszymes is THE best way to
                immediately upgrade your digestion
                and break down the candy and
                Halloween food more effectively.
                It’s the most potent digestive
                enzyme in the world, with more than
                double the protease of leading
                competitors. Optimizing your protein
                digestion is critical, not just on
                Halloween, but every single day.

            <p>
                Many digestive issues—including
                heartburn, gas, and acid reflux—are
                caused by a LACK of hydrochloric acid.
                HCL Breakthrough is a plant-based form
                of this critical nutrient, helping
                restore proper digestion, and making
                it so you can power through the most
                hard-to-digest foods.
