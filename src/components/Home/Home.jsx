                    Halloween may not seem as “heavy” as
                    other holidays when it comes to food...
                    ... but don’t let that fool you.
                    If you’re going to indulge on Halloween,
                    there are some things to be aware of.
                    This short page will help you understand
                    how to “cheat” this week—and not feel horrible.

                    Turn Sugary Toxins Into
                    Super Nutrients
                </h3>
                <p>
                    You already know sugar is toxic.
                    It spikes blood sugar, warps your
                    insulin (and other hormones),
                    feeds candida, and can be easily
                    converted into fat.
                    But if you have an abundance of good
                    bacteria in your gut and while you’re
                    consuming the sugar—the bacteria will
                    eat most of it up before it does damage.
                    Which means, instead of a toxin—the sugar
                    you consume becomes a growth accelerator
                    for your probiotics.
                    I’ve personally tested eating sugary
                    foods/desserts—with and without P3-OM,
                    and the difference is night and day.
                    P3-OM absolutely improves your ability
                    to handle (and even benefit) from sugar,
                    and that’s essential this Halloween.

                    Milk Protein Is Another
                    Big Halloween Hurdle
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A very high percentage of Halloween candies are chocolate.
                    Milk chocolate, to be precise.
                    And milk protein is one of the
                    most hard-to-digest substances in
                    existence.
                    You don’t want that protein
                    sitting in your gut, rotting
                    and creating other issues.
                    This is where enzymes come in.
                    If you take enzymes whenever
                    you eat milk chocolate, you’ll
                    have less inflammation and less
                    negative gut-related issues.

                    Foods Are Not Easy to Digest
                </h3>

                    Because the colors and additives,
                    sugar, milk, the flood of carbs
                    eaten all at the same time...
                    gastric distress is huge around
                    Halloween.
                    But there’s a way to turbocharge
                    your ability to eat and digest
                    difficult foods.
                    It’s called hydrochloric acid or
                    HCL, and it helps create an
                    intestinal environment where
                    everything you consume can be
                    effectively broken down.
                    Both Matt and I have experimented
                    with doing big “cheat days” with
                    and without HCL, and the difference isn’t even close.
                    HCL makes it so much easier to
                    digest all the sweets, sugars and
                    heavy foods—and HCL Breakthrough
                    is the most potent version of this
                    critical digestive acid.
