# Halloween Bio-Optimizer

## Description

_Duration: 3 Hours_

This app was built to show the benefits of P3-OM, Masszymes, and HCL Breakthrough. At the onset of the project I ran into an issue with my package manager, and ended up having to create a new branch on an existing project in order for it to run!
